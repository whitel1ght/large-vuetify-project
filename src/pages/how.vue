    <h1>HOW</h1>

    <p class="text-center">
    The importance of not just thinking about what you’re doing, but also how you’re doing it, lies in the realization that there is more to success than
simply completing tasks. It involves considering the manner in which you approach and execute your actions, as this can greatly impact the quality of
your work and the overall outcome. By paying attention to both the “what” and the “how,” you can refine your processes, identify areas for improvement,
and ultimately achieve greater success in your endeavors.
